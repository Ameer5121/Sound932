Hello there. I am an Israeli developer. ðŸ‘‹

# C# Developer
I am a C# developer who mostly likes to develop games and Windows based applications. I am also open to the idea of trying out anything that is interesting!

# Current WIP Projects
Current and only project I am working on right now:
* ðŸ”­ [Chit-Chat](https://github.com/Sound932/Chit-Chat). It's a social chatting application for Windows and has some aspects from Discord. I've been working on this project with the intention of it helping me land my first job.


# ðŸ“« Reaching me
For any questions regarding [Chit-Chat](https://github.com/Sound932/Chit-Chat) or any project I have, you can contact me through Discord: **Sound#9535** or through my Email Address: shehadyamer@gmail.com
